# Glowmesh
This is a thin mesh abstraction for glow. Its very ooga booga style: simply implemented per common vertex type. For now XYZRGBA. The _build2d module is for 2d rendering, providing functionality for triangle, quad and polygon rendering (more to come like lines etc).


examples/triangle should be a good starting point for OpenGL application development. Except rn the triangle isnt drawing, stay tuned...
